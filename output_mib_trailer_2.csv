18,Kunal Tomar,02:23 is hilarious
19,its ya boi dipshit cow,This looks like a modern spy kids movie. What a mess.
20,Laurent Siebenmann,Pourquoi ces quelques images rapides avant le trailer? Les gens ne sont plus capables de regarder une bande-annonce de 2 minutes? Il faut un résumé pour les ados impatients et incapables de se concentrer plus de dix secondes?
21,Pixie Bubbles,I'm only watching cause Thor is in it.
22,Enkhjin Bymbabat,This is Thor? and Asgard?
23,Ma Hugo,Will Smith became Genie so no agent j.........

30,McSuperfly,Didn’t you watch the trailer? “I found _YOU._ I’m perfect for this job”
31,lindinle,Men and Women not in Theater.
32,lindinle,the animated cartoon  was way better than this. because it wasnt written for  [and by] stupid people
33,lindinle,"how about rename the movie to

38,Alex Mazurek,Oh no are we gonna see Lexus unnecessarily sponsoring another movie?
39,tyler ross,Should be called Man and Women in Black lol this movie looks stupid because of the fact they replaced one of the dudes with a chick
40,DEFAET Victory,Thor wakiri
41,archie parkin,They called it “international” because they didn’t want to compare it to will smiths
42,lindinle,too late.
43,AlexDeactivateMC,MIB was my childhood. I watched the movies and played the vidogame with my cousins. Can't wait for this one to come out. I also loved these two from Thor: Ragnorak
44,Mr Wonderful,How can they screw up MIB so badly.
45,lindinle,watch the trailer.
46,Denmark,"*Men* In Black


Why is there a woman? Why are all great films suddenly being replaced with women, it is so stupid."
47,lindinle,"@Denmark yeah, i agree as well. i seriously got ghostbusters 2016 vibes from this."
48,Denmark,"@Mackenzie Lefler she was more of a boss than an actual agent going on missions, but this is going too far, all great movies are being replaced with 'diversity' and 'progressivism' which is ruining it. Many fans of the original movies would agree."
49,Mackenzie Lefler,Denmark you’re kidding right? Emma Thompson has been in the series since the beginning and obviously is female and an agent. There were female agents in the film series before this one. They just made one part of the focused team.
50,Infamous,"Feminism ruins another one, sigh...."

135,Kim van der Linden,That lil froggy thing is so frickin cute what the hell? ps: I wasn't that excited about the movie but now I am. :'D
136,Josh Pullen,How could they ruin this franchise! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make these films work!!!! It’s like making a Rambo movie without Sylvester Stallone! Not even gonna bother watching this! DOES ANYONE ESLE AGREE?
137,IzEror,"Excited except for the stupid ""men and women in black"" bit. It's 'Men in Black' as in Humans. They deal with aliens. It's an important distinction. In the first 2 films they made it clear to me: MIB didn't care so long as the suit was black and the person wearing it was human. Bah whatever."

148,Spicy Mike,Wtf is this bullshit no will smith or tommy lee jones I hate when they don’t keep the original actors who was apart of this franchise come on now is this a joke cause it ain’t funny
149,Joseph Vijay,"The film is going to end up just like the Ghost busters  ""reboot""!"
150,McSuperfly,"Why, because there’s a female MIB agent? You know the original movie ended with Linda Fiorentino’s character destroying the bug monster and becoming a MIB agent right?"
151,m l,"And of course they had to remake it with a woman being the agent and the woman being the head of the MIB department. Not watching , thanks."
152,McSuperfly,Emma Thompson was already established as the head of MIB in the last movie and the original literally ended with a women becoming an agent 🤦‍♂️
153,Lic Ma,Part 2 of Thor Ragnarok
154,Ryan Lay,Should be named man in black
155,Dalton Gray,What a joke
156,Henry R,Should be woman and man in black; it’s not really men in black. this is a joke

158,Lou,"No Will Smith?
No Tommy Lee Jones?






Screw that! I'm out of here."
159,McSuperfly,"I’d be surprised if their characters aren’t referenced at some point (in fact that’s probably them at 0:22 wiping her parents memory) but plenty of franchises eventually move forward with new characters in an attempt to jumpstart things. Let’s be honest, nobody was clamouring for another MIB, with or without Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. 

Besides, we could’ve ended up with that MIB/21 Jump Street crossover that Amy Pascal wanted to do."
160,Lou,"@McSuperfly Because their characters is what made this franchise popular. It wasn't necessary for them to be the main protagonists in this movie. Having them even as supporting character could have even worked out. But cutting them off the series is quite offensive. And to be honest, Chris Hemsworth isn't funny at all."
161,McSuperfly,"We’ve had three movies with them, what’s wrong with freshening up the franchise with some new actors? (Although I will admit that Tessa Thompson comes off a bit arrogant and unlikable in these trailers)."
162,David Sastre,"Without respect, we reject."
163,MTrenchon,"In any movie he appears or different name in movies, I still called him Thor"
164,Noname daguyBloopers,If you wanna know what Thor 4 will look like this is it...

175,CooManTunes,"It's really funny and painfully contrived that the two leads in Men In Black are always a white person and black person.  K recruited J because he could chase down an alien on foot.  Not because he was black. :'D  Hollywood can be exhaustingly stupid, man."

234,Claire Warner,"I'm gonna say... 'hell no.' Yes I liked Thor 3... I like the actors but this isn't even in the spirit of MIB. MIB works because most of the cast (except Will Smith) treated alien invasions and end of the world scenarios like another day at the office in an extremely dead-pan fashion. This is 'wooot...yeah let's go and get them aliens....wooot... Someone fell over in gunge... man isn't that so funny'. Both actors in this are playing exactly the same character... both cocky, over the top and overly comedic. MIB worked because Will Smith and Tommy Lee-Jones weren't the same character. Will played a newbie and he get most of the comedy elements... Tommy was more dead-pan, sarcastic and serious. That movie had some heart... this looks like Thor 3 on steroids."

This types of movies are garbage and the people are seeing right through this crap and boycotting it. Keep making this garbage and watch as you will continue to lose money and fans.

1887,TheGameKeeper94,"Ok, Im sure Sony didnt expect Endgame to end as it did. But its events just makes these casting choices funny. Then there's Spider Man FFA bringing the Multiverse in. MIB is a Marvel comic.

I cant help but look at the MIB films as their own Earth now, one where Thor & Valkyrie are MIB agents. 

It would be badass if Marvel uses the Multiverse as a way to not only get an MCU SpiderMan/Sony Venom crossover going, but to have crossovers between Marvel & every other Sony property. 

There's a Morbius film coming, a Blade/Morbius crossover would be sick. What if Sony brings back Andrew Garfield's Spider Man, but have SpiderGwen & Miles there, basically be a live-action SpiderVerse, and that has crossovers with MCU Spidey?

A SHIELD/MIB crossover, Will & Samuel together, would be crazy. If Disney bought Sony's film assets anytime soon, the Multiverse is the perfect way to avoid recasts.

Anyway, this will certainly be a fun film. But Will & Tommy better get a few scenes. If MIB is compromised, the film cant *NOT* have them around. At best, a post-credit scene with them would be alright."

2897,TonyLavagnaArt,"I had no idea who was responsible for this production then the scene came where Chris says ""the men and woman in black"" and i was like, ok this is definitely the work of Sony, and low and behold, it is. I'd have thought they'd reconsider pushing an agenda after Ghostbusters 2016, but it would seem they still wont give up. It's not that I and others dont agree with the sentiment, it's just that we dont like having it forced down our throats. Call it petty but I wont be watching this film now that I know there's an agenda."

It's immersion breaking. I will keep asking myself what Thor and Valkyrie are doing wearing suits. Should've included 1 but not both. And then the villian has the same powers as Loki on top of that? ugh.

4619,LuCKyy ツ,"So, for the many of you wondering what happened to Thor and Valkyrie right here in this trailer, here it is. When Thor went back in time in EndGame, he saw Valkyrie. Thor went up to her but she didn’t know what was going on. But then this old lady comes up to them, kidnaps them, brainwashes them, and makes them live this alternate timeline. Warning for spoilers in EndGame. Oh wait, should’ve but that in the beginning"

4642,Anggun Safira,Thor and Valkryie
4643,Willy_ Will777,How the hell did Chris Hemsworth have time to film this and End Game
4644,Joshua Chen,Endgame filmed right after infinity war. They most likely filmed this in 2018
4645,DrStench13,A lot of film productions are shot in just a few weeks. And it easily happened more than a year ago as well. Especially if there is a lot of effects in it. Which are done after the filming and can take a year to do as well. The actors only play a very tiny part in a production and are actually unemployed for most of the year or preparing for roles.
4646,CosmicFrank,Endgame and infinity war were filmed around the same time. So around 2017 makes sense
4647,Kamran Forbes,@Farters no its just i thought endgame was filmed in 2018
4648,Farters,"Kamran Forbes marvel cinematic universe gets things done quickly,"
4649,Roket Rakun,Chris❤Tessa love +1
4650,jsland,Trailer just gave away the entire movie.
4651,scuba smith,It's MEN in black so why is there a woman? Stop this PC inclusion BS. Just because men do something doesn't mean women need go and do it too. Do you see men constantly trying to go and do things women do? NO. There's nothing to prove. Forcing women where they otherwise wouldn't be is only positing that an inherent inferiority exists. Stop trying to make them like men. Go woke go broke. I hope this franchise goes the way of gillette -  down the toilet. Garbage.

5140,Scott Warnick,@Open N Review so what you are telling me is women should have no business being in a lead role in a Men In Black movie correct
5141,Open N Review,They are but woman are not needed here. There are plenty of other movies they can play in. Again... ruined a good movie
5142,Scott Warnick,@Open N Review not every movie has to just about men. Besides men in black is an organization not just about guys woman can also join. Woman are just as talented as guys in the field work

Also if some chicks downvoted a movie to the tune of 50k downvotes, it would be political activism and ""inclusion"", but when that happened on Rotten Tomatoes to the new Captain Marvel with guys downvoting it, it was deemed ""trolling and vandalism"", and the votes were hidden. Talk about dual standards. It got to a point that even in cable TV, it is difficult to watch any channel that is not broadcasting a SWJ movie or serie.  Now even Chinese movies got into the same bullshit. Give us a break. Please make quality movies and not ones that have a race and sex political agenda behind. But well, since Holywood is in a PC cruzade, why not remaking ""Pretty Woman"" with a transgender (I would say two guys, but that boat seems to already have sailed a few years ago...in vogue today black women, next few years it will be black trangenders??)? Hey Hollywood, you heard it first here.

5488,Stormer248,"Because if not, you get ""called out"" for discrimination. Case & point, the reactionaries to Dunkirk. The video games industry is the same way. 

Frankly, I jumped ship from the MCU because of this particular actress. No way am I going to accept a half-black, half-Latino woman as a Valkyrie within any facet of any work of fiction. 

It still makes my blood boil that they made Asgard as ""diverse"" as NYC with a Latino/black Valkyrie, an African gate keeper, an Asian general, and dozens of ""coloured"" extras... yet kept Wakanda as a black ethnostate. It's racial favouritism. 

I swore Ragnarok t be my last film. I made an exception to They Shall Not Grow Old, but aside from that, I'm done with the racist Hollywood industry and their incessant need to blackwash and/or feminize everything for virtue points at their award ceremonies.

No doubt if they rebooted LOTR, it'd be full of minorities as well. Trans orcs, a female Sauron lookalike for the villain, multiracial human settlements abroad, and Samoan Hobbits."

I must say that they have an interesting backstory to establish the new main character. It's one thing that she did not get her memory erased. It's another that she actually found MIB. She does raise a very valid question; ""How many people can say that? I found you.""

5730,VirtueOfTheLessBrilliant,@Stormer248 lol
5731,videoplusdvd,The same reason nobody buys them on home video anymore. When people are actually willing to see it the theatre for $50 after admission and snacks.  Movies are not a cheap date anymore. Most will wait for PPV or digital rentals

5744,A_Shred Gaming,people in black *
5745,just1nmcd,MEN in black. Lead character a female... women don't belong everywhere. You wouldn't see a man trying to play Annie in the musical now would you
5746,just1nmcd,This movie is going to suck. Has nothing on Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones... Quit remaking old movies
5747,MIKE CRUZ,This would be so much better with Rocket  and Groot .
5748,B randon,I'm sure they're going to explain this in the movie but how is their a woman in the MEN in Black organization?

Red Skull: What you seek lies in front of you. As does what you fear.
Gamora: What’s this?
Red Skull: The price. Soul holds a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it is a certain wisdom.
Thanos: Tell me what it needs.
Red Skull: To ensure whoever possesses it, understands its power, the Stone demands a sacrifice.
Thanos: Of what?
Red Skull: In order to take the Stone you must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul.
Gamora: All my life, I dreamed of a day, a moment, when you got what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But, now… You kill, and torture, and you call it mercy. The Universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize and it told you, no. You failed. And do you want to know why? Because you love nothing. No one.
[Thanos turns and Gamora sees tears in his eyes]
Gamora: Really? Tears?
Red Skull: They’re not for him.
Gamora: No. This isn’t love.
Thanos: I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.
[Gamora tries to kill herself with the double-edged knife Thanos had given her, but it turns into bubbles]
Thanos: I’m sorry, little one.
Gamora: No!

EDIT: I think I kinda get what's missing for me... The first MIB duo is about one father figure and a hot headed youth. This one looked like two office workers. Office workers aren't bad, but they aren't that interesting.

The first MIB sets a pretty good tone that's easy to connect to. This one though... I can't connect. Also, Will Smith had that funky, cop vibe around him. These two on the other hand... I can't erase the image of Valhalla in my head."

6228,Khoo Productions,if be funny if black widow jumped off a cliff to get the soul stone and iron came died saving the world by snapping the fingers with the gauntlet

6258,raimesey,I don’t like these reboots where they shoe horn a few women in and insert a few cringe equality jokes. I’d much rather see a stand alone film with a leading lady and a different story line. It’s lazy writing and it’s unoriginal.

6292,BooBop1987,I can't to see this movie!
6293,Anfmethodjor,I feel like this eill be better than all of the previus MIB movies combined. Crossing fingers! 🤞🏾
6294,Jeahav  Valentin,Anfmethodjor I'm with you on that one 2000% and definitely agree with you wholeheartedly that this movie has potential to be better than the 3 previous Men In Black Movies especially part 1
6295,Manan Gupta,Song name- wtf(where they from)
6296,sudha kar,Wow thor 😍😍..Valkyrie 😍
6297,craig199,"I’m all for gender equality, but come on. The name is ‘men in black’. Why are they trying to revamp a classic duo."

6299,Mohammad Monis,mib vs fucking avengers
6300,Szk fury,Kids movie. Funny animated cartoons 😁😂
6301,Jenxao,GREAT! Now I don't need to see the film.
6302,OdaKa,"@Jenxao I mean, most likely that scene isn't going ta be executed in a way that maximizes intensity in the full movie anyway... those scenes are never really effective anyway. You already know it's gonna work out, unless you've never seen a movie before. And there's sooooo much more movie in the movie than the 2% that's shown in a trailer. We basically already know ""the story"" of any movie, unless it's designed with like major plot twists and stuff. It's just how the story unfolds that makes the experience. I suppose knowing through pop-culture that Darth Vader is Luke's father before ever seeing the movie ruins the shock effect of the reveal but... like... oh well, lol."
6303,Jenxao,"@OdaKa I agree that the it might not take away from the overall 'experience', but it might. Trailers like this spoil the story, which is a pretty significant part of the 'experience'. 

E.g. How tense can a scene in which someone is hanging off the edge of a cliff be if you already know they're alive in the next scene?"
6304,OdaKa,As if knowing the basic plot of a movie destroys the experience of seeing it
6305,S Dawoo,I know right!!!!that's why I didn't want to watch or hear about anything concerning Endgame...trailers and to much talk spoils the movie.
6306,Syed Zain,What's the song in the background?
6307,Fiyadara,Is no one else here for Les Twins?? They look so amazing I can’t wait!
6308,Wolfgang Rush,[ I want in ]... That's a lame excuse to participate somewhere

6325,John Lester,Might be worth a watch. On Redbox...
6326,Robert Green,"Still going to give it a go, but I don't know why, it still feels like it's hitting the same notes as the latest original MIB movies except it's Thor and Valkyrie as the MIB agents. I was hoping for a more eerie, investigative vibe like the cartoon, but the story and the villain seems cool though."
6327,Alex ???,M&WINB
6328,Reza Rafly Ramadhan,"I hope some cameo from the ""original"" MIB,, in this movie"
6329,TheBraunMachine2011,I'm think that's what is gonna happen. I think Will & TLJ will have a cameo in it at some point. :)

6537,TheBraunMachine2011,"Honestly, F. Gary Gray's a good director, he directed Fast 8, not the original, that was Rob Cohen. Gray's directed films like A Man Apart, Fast 8, The Negotiator, Set it Off, Law Abiding Citizen, The Italian Job, Friday & Straight Outta Compton. And they are good movies. The only film of his was kinda meh, give or take a few performances was Be Cool. While this doesn't feel like MIB IMHO, it still looks like it could be fun."

6602,Can she get it?,Thomas Simpson what I’m saying is leave old franchises alone. Let them be what they are and make something new. Seems like every other film that comes out is either a reboot or a sequel of old franchises that made a ton of money and it’s honestly so lazy when you take into account the amount of money these big time producers actually make. All it takes is a bit of imagination. Something everyone clearly seems to lack these days.

There were going to be women at some point.
Will Smith's character worked along side one at the end of the 1st or 2nd movie.

7204,Melvin Chong,"As usual, compensating a poor plot with tons of CGI, and with SJW agenda thrown in for good measure."
7205,Melvin Chong,@Agon LeedWhy not let the ticket sales speaks for itself and then come back for an argument ? Defending a shitty movie with tons of words ain't gonna redeem this crap. It's people like you that make people like us hate watching movies these days.
7206,Agon Leed,"@Melvin Chong let's see..the fact theres a female? Most people are complaining about that. Forgetting that st the end of one of the movies, agent J was working with a female. That idea is way before this era.
Also forgetting the head of this division was a female. I guess people, just think she never had to have field time and rise to the top.

Talking about race? Well, that would just be stupid.
Telling about that ""men and women in black""
If you pay attention that joke was made directly for you. 
LOOK at it. He was the bumbling fool who thought he HAD to say that. And the reply he got was her look saying, "" yeah, ok, whatever. just get on with it"" and the aliens comment was satire.
Basically it showed the stupidity of people whom think they HAVE to force it.

So again..watching the whole trailer and seeing that..wheres the sjw agenda?"
7207,Melvin Chong,@Agon Leed Go find it. Has to be in there somewhere if you can't see it on the surface.

7279,Agon Leed,"@adam b I think it was the second. Have you ever seen the movies?
Agent K quit. Agent J, in the end of the movie, I think had a female partner.
Made me think the next movie was going to be Will with a female partner.

And I've been on YouTube since it started. Have had multiple accounts cause it was never important to keep up with them..especially in the beginning.
While people are using it as part of their lives, I just view videos when I'm bored. 
You dont see much activity cause I literally do not live on youtube. I live on Facebook lol"
7280,adam b,"@Agon Leed  You're literally on YouTube only to comment and look up black panther videos you contribute Zero. Devils advocate question: Why is Charlies Angels specifically women, but MEN in Black  isnt only men? Did the first MIB hint towards it or did they work/hint  towards it later?"
7281,Agon Leed,"@adam b you're talking about switching Charlie's Angels, adding a guy, to a group specifically female in every iteration all because you see a female partner in MIB.
And if you watched the earlier movie, unlike Charlie's angel, there were already hints and an example of agents being female.
I'm pointing out truths while you're being the troll"

7696,Anshuman Raj,"@Harry Vlogs when did I objected the opinion? I think it's unfair to not give the movie a fair chance and concluding that it won't be good enough. If you(any person) don't like the trailer I can understand it, but since an actor isn't in this movie that's why you don't like the movie is kind of unjust to the script writers and movie-makers."
7697,Harry Vlogs,"@Anshuman Raj You singled me out and gave a reasoning for my ""decision"". The very definition of a conclusion ignoring that for a minute. This wasn't a discussion about the plausibility that people might have different tastes in movies, instead it was the point made above regarding one person's opinion and your objection."
7698,Anshuman Raj,"@Harry Vlogs oh this is my fav emoji😂😂😂. And about the conclusion, that wasn't exactly a conclusion that's an option of many possible outcomes for the movie goers. And chill dude it's just another movie. Why so serious?😂😂"
7699,Ivan Torres,So thats the thing now? Theyre replacing all men in all the classic movies? Im done. And im not sexist but this is too much. Ruining good ol classics just to fit their agenda.

7724,T. Va.,Funny I hadnot watched even a quarter of the trailer and already saw the group is compromised theme being weaved in to the plot. Dissapointed that I was tight. Its a very cliche and an overused one.
7725,Bobo Boy,"@Joshua Johnson nope, this movie is the same as the first movie. Go watch the first movie and you will know it. They just swap character because diversity quota must be fulfill."
7726,Joshua Johnson,@merlin1964 so basically its captain marvel
7727,guinnesschili,Cause it sounds cringy but has some good actors. Hopefully not to pc.
7728,merlin1964,"Well the first trailer seemed to be just a bunch of special effects and look at all the shiny trinkets. This trailer is better because it hints at a story of some aliens infiltrating MIB. I wish they were mocking pc culture, but I am guessing they are embracing it."

8110,DOP Shooter,Don't know why but vfx and practical effects in old MIB was much better than this. 👍 if you agree
8111,DOP Shooter,@Jeahav  Valentin absolutely it has to better than previous parts otherwise no point making a new version
8112,Jeahav  Valentin,shaizad ali For me I just can't wait to check this movie out and it's definitely going to be way way better than the 3 previous Men In Black Movies especially part 1
8113,DOP Shooter,@Jeahav  Valentin agreed its has to be  entertaining. However being a cinematographer i have slightly more importance towards visual
8114,Jeahav  Valentin,shaizad ali It doesn't matter as long as the movie is immensely entertaining to our satisfaction

So this movie will prob not be that great but deff won't be as good or better than the first movie. That being said it will probably make money because it is going to piggy back off avangers. All the comments are Thor and Valkyrie. Not about the MIB movie.

You know people like you are fading away at the same rate as the Vegans are right now.
You had your chance but you all blew it by being obnoxious and well just not nice people.
The actions of people like you have set back Women Lib and tolerance a hundred years at least.
I grew up long before you were born and we had some very strong and sexy women in the movies and we all loved it.
Then you people came along and now everyone is so tired of all of this and well it's all you and your peoples fault.
Nice job clap clap."

I'm sooo tired of cocky female vs. stiff weak white male.
That combo didn't work the first hundred times so why should it work now.

8817,Smashplayer 01,The Men in Black with women makes perfect sense. I think I'll be avoiding this obvious feminist flick and watch the original.
8818,BlindEagle Ace,"Dude. Why? Why even come here if you're not even a fan or haven't seen the original Men in Black.
They had 4 female agents in the original. Two of them were shown in the movie. Literally in MIB 3, the organization is run by a female agent. In MIB 1, Agent K and Agent J are saved by a woman who later becomes an Agent.

You obviously never read the comics, or played the video games, or watched the first three movies.
So please, dont make the rest of us fans look bad with such ignorance.
You clearly weren't going to see it anyway."

8958,RM J,@Vincent H. You're right. New entries in a franchise don't ruin originals. People though don't like when things they like are associated with something they consider poor quality. They wish they had a neuralizer to erase it from their minds.

8960,contractkilla HD,This is literally just a spinoff
8961,Vincent H.,@VlP KSA How would a new movie destroy your childhood memories? I saw people say the same thing about the new Ghost busters. Literally that makes no sense. A new movie doesn't erase or take away the original I just don't get that. If you have no interest in the remake don't see it then.

9060,Biggie Smalls,Tommy Lee Jones. Tommy Lee is a musician.
9061,Tiara Blackwood,"Personally hate seeing comments like these, so what if a classical movie doesn't have the same actors as before, the world is evolving and more actors are coming into the industry, instead of bashing them for major roles, see the movie then judge it and don't go in the movie with a mindset that it suck just because it does not have Will Smith and Tommy Lee."

At least Will Smith was an average guy.. but with chicks they ALWAYS have to make them overtly smart, strong, witty.. FAR more than previous male counterparts. Its not believable as they try too hard in their attempt to virtue signal and pander. Hollywood is full of SJWs and thunderous beta cucks so thirsty to see women on screen they’ll compromise good, realistic storylines to ram through some nonsensical women-power agenda."

9896,Cabooselololol,"Looking forward to this. While there is no Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones, I believe with a good script and story, the franchise can easily exist without them. The world of MIB was always so filled with potential, this movie looks for a good way to expand that, while also keeping the originals in tact (aka not a reboot or remake, but a spinoff). Plus they choose great actors for the role and look to be following a fully new storyline with no correlation with the existing movies besides the world (with easter eggs to the previous films like the previous trailers giant cockroach fight and those weird aliens who drink coffee) .

Looking forward to the film!"

10920,L,"@Brenton Goldfinch-Belbin didn't trigger me, don't care. I think virgin neckbeards like yourselves are hilarious lmao. Have a great miserable life bud."
10921,Brenton Goldfinch-Belbin,"@L I'm sorry I triggered you mate 😂🤣

Got a issue with me I would be happy to talk over Messenger or elsewhere. Don't worry. I'm sure you will greatly enjoy the movie as it is targeted towards SJWs such as yourself."
10922,L,@Brenton Goldfinch-Belbin you know it's really obvious when you like your own comment xD also it's sad you haven't seen that vine bc it's you! Look it up
10923,Brenton Goldfinch-Belbin,@L I guess that is somewhat more imaginative then a mom joke. I still think you are 12 though.

10958,kk Krish,I remembered a dialogue from deadpool 2 when you mentioned x-men :: the name x-men is sexist coz women also r there and we call ourselves the x-force
10959,Mac,"Men in black is a name. It's only called that because the original 5 agents were men. That does not mean only men can be agents. The first film had a woman agent as a new recruit at the end, and the third film had one as the new head of New York's MIB. Also, X-men have women mutants too."

11678,DSpectrumMan,@bineata What are you talking about? Because Chris's character made a joke saying that they're the men and women in black that automatically makes the film SJW propoganda? Okay then...
11679,Travis Laneve,@Nigga White it's more of a spin-off than anything. It's not even numbered. It just takes place in the same universe with all of the events of the previous film having taken place.
11680,Nigga White,"@Travis Laneve Because it had the original boys, this one has everyone new so it's a reboot, not some sort of sequel."
11681,christian schmidt,@WarpPal The funny thing is that Chris Hemsworth is not a good actor...
11682,Nakaka Hilo,I think it’s in another movie all together thus “international” it’s not a reboot
11683,Bruce,I'm pretty sure this movie's gonna be pretty bad. Most sequels or entries to another franchise that has already been thought of as meeting it's mark a long time ago never really succeed at all.
